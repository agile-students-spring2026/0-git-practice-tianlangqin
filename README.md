# Agile Software Development

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
### From the Wiki:
Agile software development is an umbrella term for approaches to developing software that reflect the values and principles agreed upon by The Agile Alliance, a group of 17 software practitioners, in 2001. As documented in their Manifesto for Agile Software Development, the practitioners value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

The practitioners cite inspiration from new practices at the time including extreme programming, scrum, dynamic systems development method, adaptive software development, and being sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation-driven, heavyweight software development processes.
