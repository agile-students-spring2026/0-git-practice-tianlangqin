# Significance of Free Software

**Reference:** Free Software Foundation. [What is free software?](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) GNU Operating System.

One thing I found interesting about this article is how the author argues that software should not only be a purely commercial product but an ethical instrument of user freedom. The author makes the clear distinction that the "free" in free software means the same as the "free" in "free speech" instead of the one in "free beer". It highlights the importance of transparency and community collaboration in developing software. For a software to qualify as a free software, it must satisfy the below four freedoms: 

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

I also found it ironic that they called the licence for free software "copyleft".

**Comment by Max Wu:** Great article, I agree that software freedom is important for the community.
